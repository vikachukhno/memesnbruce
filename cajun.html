    <h2>jambalaayyyaaaa (i still don't know wtf that is i grew up in MN but here it is)</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>ingredients:</strong><br>
        1 pound Andouille (Cajun) or mild smoked pork sausage, sliced 1/4-inch thick<br>
        1 1/2 pound boneless skinless chicken thigh meat, cubed<br>
        1 pound ground Italian sausage (mild)<br>
        1 pound cubed ham<br>
        2 cups onions, diced<br>
        1 cup bell pepper<br>
        2 tbsp minced fresh garlic<br>
        1/2 cup Old Bays Seafood seasoning (in all), divided<br>
        1/2 tbsp ground black pepper<br>
        1/2 tbsp white pepper<br>
        1/2 tbsp red pepper<br>
        3/4 tbsp thyme leaves<br>
        3/4 tbsp basil leaves<br>
        3 to 4 medium bay leaves<br>
        5 cups chicken stock<br>
        1 beer (that's a lie you need 14 but 1 for the recipe)<br>
        3 cups long grain rice<br>
        1/2 cup chopped parsley leaves<br>
        <strong>directions:</strong><br>
        Add red, black and white peppers to mixture and cook until veggies are translucent, about 5-7 minutes over medium-high heat. Again use the spoon to scrape the meat from sticking and burning to the bottom of the pot.<br>
        Add the ham and garlic and cook for another minute stirring and scraping bottom of pot to not scorch garlic. Add the remaining Old Bay seasoning, thyme, basil and bay leaves; stir. Return chicken and sausage to pot; mix and fold. Cook over low heat for 10 minutes. This will give the seasonings time to release their oils and flavors.<br>
        Add beer to deglaze pan scraping about 2 minutes. Add the stock and bring to a boil. Add the rice and fold in. Return to a slow boil and cook uncovered for about 5 minutes stirring and scraping pan bottom so rice does not stick and burn to pan bottom; mix in parsley. Reduce heat to the lowest possible setting and simmer, covered, for at least 30-35 minutes. Do not remove the cover while the rice is steaming.<br>
        After uncovering there may be some liquid remaining on top. Fold the rice in (DO NOT STIR). Turn off heat and let stand till liquid is absorbed. Remove bay leaves. Enjoy!<br>
